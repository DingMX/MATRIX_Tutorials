## Roadmap
Part 1: [Why Machine Learning Matters](https://medium.com/machine-learning-for-humans/why-machine-learning-matters-6164faf1df12). The big picture of artificial intelligence and machine learning — past, present, and future.

Part 2.1: [Supervised Learning.](Part 2.1: Supervised Learning) Learning with an answer key. Introducing linear regression, loss functions, overfitting, and gradient descent.

Part 2.2: [Supervised Learning II](https://medium.com/@v_maini/supervised-learning-2-5c1c23f3560d). Two methods of classification: logistic regression and SVMs.

Part 2.3: [Supervised Learning III](https://medium.com/@v_maini/supervised-learning-3-b1551b9c4930). Non-parametric learners: k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests. Introducing cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble models.

Part 3: [Unsupervised Learning](https://medium.com/@v_maini/unsupervised-learning-f45587588294). Clustering: k-means, hierarchical. Dimensionality reduction: principal components analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD).

Part 4: [Neural Networks & Deep Learning](https://medium.com/@v_maini/neural-networks-deep-learning-cdad8aeae49b). Why, where, and how deep learning works. Drawing inspiration from the brain. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Real-world applications.

Part 5: [Reinforcement Learning](https://medium.com/@v_maini/reinforcement-learning-6eacf258b265). Exploration and exploitation. Markov decision processes. Q-learning, policy learning, and deep reinforcement learning. The value learning problem.
