# The Coming Era of the Zombie Token?

    Updated ICO Market Condition Observations


One month ago we published [Most ICOs Fail: Tale of Two Worlds](https://hackernoon.com/most-icos-fail-tale-of-two-worlds-d1ab7625ff66) which looked beyond the breathless, positive headlines to better understand, on a project by project basis, the important nuances of the ICO market. That data betrayed an increasingly challenging market. The real story was that an increasing number of ICOs failed to achieve their funding objectives, often quite dramatically.

## Update: What Happened Over the Past Month?

The headline remains very positive. In October 2017, 76 projects completed their ICO raising the equivalent of $700mm, a record month. However, as we observed last month, the market is becoming more selective with only 26 projects, 34% of the total, a new low, hitting their funding objectives. In addition, we believe there are at least a couple of dozen projects who have announced the launch of an ICO, yet have since gone silent publicly. These findings are consistent with the anecdotal signals we experience daily.

## Criticism of Our Conclusions

Our analysis and conclusions are based upon comparing publicly announced funding objectives with actual capital raised. Our measure of success is the arbitrarily selected hurdle of raising 75% of the stated objective. This approach has been fairly criticized; arguing that raising funding at all via an ICO, regardless of amount, constitutes success. In some cases, Iâ€™d wholeheartedly agree, particularly in a situation where the team had an ambitious funding goal, fell short, but still raised tens of millions in capital.
