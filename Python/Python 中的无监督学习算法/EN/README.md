## Unsupervised Learning with Python

    Unsupervised Learning is a class of Machine Learning techniques to find the patterns in data. The data given to unsupervised algorithm are not labelled, which means only the input variables(X) are given with no corresponding output variables. In unsupervised learning, the algorithms are left to themselves to discover interesting structures in the data.

### Supervised Vs Unsupervised Learning.


In supervised learning, the system tries to learn from the previous examples that are given. (On the other hand, in unsupervised learning, the system attempts to find the patterns directly from the example given.) So if the dataset is labelled it comes under a supervised problem, it the dataset is unlabelled then it is an unsupervised problem.
